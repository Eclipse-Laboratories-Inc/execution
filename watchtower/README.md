The `solana-watchtower` program is used to monitor the health of a cluster.  It
periodically polls the cluster over an RPC API to confirm that the transaction
count is advancing, new blockhashes are available, and no validators are
delinquent.  Results are reported as InfluxDB metrics, with an optional push
notification on sanity failure.

If you only care about the health of one specific validator, the
`--validator-identity` command-line argument can be used to restrict failure
notifications to issues only affecting that validator.

If you do not want duplicate notifications, for example if you have elected to
receive notifications by SMS the
`--no-duplicate-notifications` command-line argument will suppress identical
failure notifications.

### Metrics
#### `watchtower-sanity`
On every iteration this data point will be emitted indicating the overall result
using a boolean `ok` field.

#### `watchtower-sanity-failure`
On failure this data point contains details about the specific test that failed via
the following fields:
* `test`: name of the sanity test that failed
* `err`: exact sanity failure message
